# SQL Practice Tasks

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries completed as part of database practice using **Northwind** and **Employees** databases.  
The file `sql_practice_tasks.sql` contains the full list of tasks with example solutions.

## Databases Used

1. **[Northwind](https://www.sql-practice.com/)** â€” a classic sample database for working with commercial data (orders, customers, products, suppliers).
2. **[Employees Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/)** â€” a MySQL sample database with data on employees, salaries, departments, and employment history.

## Tools

- **[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)** â€” a universal database client for working with various DBMS.
- **MySQL Server** â€” for database deployment and query execution.

## What I Learned While Writing and Analyzing Queries

- Working with **JOIN** to combine data from multiple tables.
- Using **aggregate functions** (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) and grouping data.
- Applying **window functions** (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`, `NTILE`) for deeper analysis.
- Performing **filtering and sorting** of results (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`).
- Writing queries with subqueries and CTEs (**Common Table Expressions**).
- Analyzing historical data and identifying changes over time.
- Optimizing queries for better performance.
- Interpreting results and drawing conclusions from data.
