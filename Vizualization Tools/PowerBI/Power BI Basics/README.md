# UK Airports Financial Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the financial performance of 10 airports in England for the year 2019. The goal was to build an interactive Power BI report that helps assess key financial metrics and identify important trends.

## Project Objectives

- Understand and explore the dataset thoroughly.
- Clean the data by removing rows with missing or anomalous values.
- Prepare the data by formatting columns correctly and unifying column names (e.g., renaming “Між_план” to “Expenses”).
- Create calculated columns to derive important performance indicators such as:
  - Profitability (Profit / Revenue) * 100%
  - Expenses per passenger (Expenses / Number of passengers)
- Sort the data by airport name for better readability.

## Dashboard Features

- **Overview Cards:** Show total profit, number of flights, number of canceled flights, and passenger flow across all airports.
- **Passenger Traffic Analysis:** Column chart displaying the number of passengers by month, sorted chronologically with a color scheme consistent with the dashboard theme.
- **Profitability by Airport:** Horizontal bar chart showing profitability per airport, sorted descending so the most profitable airports appear at the top.
- **Profitability and Expenses Over Time:** Line chart comparing monthly profitability and expenses, with distinct colors for clarity.
- **Profit vs Expenses Comparison:** Donut chart visualizing total profit and expenses side by side with clear labels and colors.
- **Interactive Filters:** Dropdown slicers for selecting airport name and month, enabling users to filter data across the entire dashboard.

## Design and Usability

- Added a clear title: “Overview of UK Airports Financial Performance in 2019.”
- Applied a consistent color scheme and styling across all visualizations to ensure a professional appearance.
- Set fonts, background colors, and borders to enhance readability and maintain design consistency.

## Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop for data preparation, analysis, and report creation.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed skills in data cleaning and transformation, creating interactive reports in Power BI, and visualizing financial metrics effectively. This experience improved my ability to communicate data-driven insights and make business recommendations based on analysis.
